Hello! My name is John Park, and I absolutely love to combine data science capabilities with any type of industry. I love to create mini projects that explains or demonstrates how to use said application in your everyday life.

I studied my masters at the University of Connecticut in hydrologic modeling where I used various predictive modeling techniques to predict water quantity under climate change. I did my PhD in atmospheric physics at Johns Hopkins University. As the name implies, atmospheric physics is application of physics to study the earthâ€™s atmosphere by modeling it using, including, principles of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics and by analyzing the model output data using different statistical data analysis techniques such as data mining, machine learning and data visualization. I worked with different mathematical models and large volume data from satellites, radar data and data from global climate models.

I am very passionate about different applications of data science and in my free time I enjoy writing articles on various data science topics with Spark, Python, R, Tableau, etc. on this website, DataScience+ and R-bloggers. So, keep visiting them. You will find new and interesting posts.
