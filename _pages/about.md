Hello! My name is John Park, and I absolutely love to combine data science capabilities with any type of industry. I love to create mini projects that explains or demonstrates how to use said application in your everyday life.

I studied my masters at the University of Connecticut in hydrologic modeling where I used various predictive modeling techniques to predict water quantity under climate change. I did my PhD in atmospheric physics at Johns Hopkins University. As the name implies, atmospheric physics is application of physics to study the earthâ€™s atmosphere by modeling it using, including, principles of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics and by analyzing the model output data using different statistical data analysis techniques such as data mining, machine learning and data visualization. I worked with different mathematical models and large volume data from satellites, radar data and data from global climate models.

I am very passionate about different applications of data science and in my free time I enjoy writing articles on various data science topics with Spark, Python, R, Tableau, etc. on this website, DataScience+ and R-bloggers. So, keep visiting them. You will find new and interesting posts.

Passionate, creative, and results-driven Masters' student in Computer Science with 1+ year of internship experience in software development related to Full-Stack, Deep Learning, and Data Science; in entrepreneurial and agile environments; with overall 5 years of hands-on exposure to problem-solving through research and technology; seeking Co-Op/full-time opportunities starting from January 2021/May 2021.
 
I am currently a full-time graduate student at Arizona State University pursuing a

Masters in Computer Science, with an expected graduation date in the month of May, 2021.  I consider myself as a diligent, hard-working, honest and a positive person who has always been interested in learning by taking up challenging projects where I can get to apply my analytical as well as technical problem-solving skills.  From a young age, I loved staying up-to-date with the latest technology and was always curious about their system design and development process. Additionally, Mathematics was one of my favourite subjects in school. I was aware of the applications of Mathematics in the process of development of different Computer based Systems which led me to pursue a career in Computer Science. My biggest strengths include efficient time management and team leadership skills. Moreover, I possess excellent communication skills as well, which is why I love interacting with people from different cultures and backgrounds.  

I am currently looking for full-time opportunities in areas such as Software Engineering and Machine Learning, starting from May 2021.

Apart from the academic world, I am also a trained vocalist who is really interested in music. From learning different genres of songs, ranging from Indian Classical to Western Music, it has been a wonderful journey. I wish to carry this hobby of mine along with my academics for as much time as possible.
